<h2><a href="http://projectselene.tk" target="blank">Project Selene</a></h2>
<p>Project Selene is an entry to NASA's cubequest challenge.  The challenge is to construct a microsatellite, or "cubesat," capable of orbiting the moon and communicating with earth.  We will be judged based on the amount of 1024-bit data packets we are able to relay back to earth without error.  I am in charge of designing the satellite's trajectory and finding the most fuel-efficient method of orbiting the moon and, after the mission has ended, disposing of the satellite.</p>
<h2><a href="http://challengepost.com/software/peregrine" target="blank">Peregrine</a></h2>
<p>Peregrine is a node.js server that, using twilio and applescript, can convert sms messages to imessages and vice-versa, all without requiring the user to install anything or go through any web application.  All a user needs to do in order to use Peregrine is send their message, along with its intended recipient, to the peregrine phone number or imessage account.  It was built during Hack Gen Y with <a href="http://challengepost.com/jamesobi" target="blank">James Sobieski</a> and <a href="http://challengepost.com/Cybermancan" target="blank">Nathan Morrissey</a>.
<h2><a href="http://challengepost.com/software/sketch" target="blank">Sketch</a></h2>
<p>We created sketch because we were all fans of 3d printers and saw their potential, and yet, also noticed their drawbacks.  A 3d printer has to work off of a digital schematic that has already been created.  That's fine for those comfortable with 3d modeling software, but the fact is that most people find this an obtrusive medium.  Until now, the answer to people faced with this problem has been "3d printing pens," but these have always been a gimmick at best, since their design requires the user to hold their arm completely still and move with mechanical precision a human simply cannot possess.  Either that or produce a final product wrought with the signs of human error.  In essence, sketch is a robotic arm with a 3d printing pen attached to it.  This allows users to intuitively control the print job, but still maintain the mechanical precision that makes 3d printers so useful.  This project was created with <a href="http://challengepost.com/Mateoabascal" target="blank">Mateo Abascal</a>, <a href="http://challengepost.com/cybermancan" target="blank">Nathan Morrissey</a>, and <a href="http://challengepost.com/SYichen" target="blank">Yichen Su</a>
