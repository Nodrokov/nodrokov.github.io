<p>Project Selene is an entry to NASA's cubequest challenge.  The challenge is to construct a microsatellite, or "cubesat," capable of orbiting the moon and communicating with earth.  We will be judged based on the amount of 1024-bit data packets we are able to relay back to earth without error.  I am in charge of designing the satellite's trajectory and finding the most fuel-efficient method of orbiting the moon and, after the mission has ended, disposing of the satellite.</p>
